Take number of processes n
For each process
   Take process id, arrival time and burst time

Set time = 0
Set completed = 0
Mark all processes as not done

While completed is less than n
   min_burst = very large value
   selected = -1

   For each process
      If process has arrived (arrival time <= time)
      and process is not completed
         If its burst time is smaller than min_burst
            Update min_burst
            Select this process
         End if
      End if
   End for

   If no process is selected
      Increase time by 1 (CPU is idle)
   Else
      Set start time of selected process = time
      Add burst time to time
      Set completion time
      Calculate turnaround time
      Calculate waiting time
      Mark process as completed
      Increase completed count
